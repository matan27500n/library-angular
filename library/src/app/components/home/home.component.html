<h3>General knowledge</h3>
<p>
  A library is a curated collection of sources of information and similar
  resources, selected by experts and made accessible to a defined community for
  reference or borrowing, often in a quiet environment conducive to study. It
  provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical
  location or a virtual space, or both. The first libraries consisted of
  archives of the earliest form of writingâ€”the clay tablets in cuneiform script
  discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal
  libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th
  century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical period, the
  great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople
  and Alexandria. The libraries of Timbuktu were also established around this
  time and attracted scholars from all over the world.
