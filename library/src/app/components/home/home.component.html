      <h2>General knowledge</h2>
      <p [ngClass]="{'show-less': showShortDescription}">A library is a curated collection of sources of information and
        similar
        resources, selected by experts and made accessible to a defined community for
        reference or borrowing, often in a quiet environment conducive to study. It
        provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical
        location or a virtual space, or both. The first libraries consisted of
        archives of the earliest form of writingâ€”the clay tablets in cuneiform script
        discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal
        libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th
        century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical period, the
        great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople
        and Alexandria. The libraries of Timbuktu were also established around this
        time and attracted scholars from all over the world.</p>
